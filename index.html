            <p>
               Hey there! Thanks for taking a moment to get to know me. I'm a junior at Texas A&M University, studying Computer Engineering, 
               and I'm set to graduate in December 2024. I grew up in Houston, and I've always had a love for the outdoors. One of my all-time favorite hobbies is saltwater fishing. 
               But when I'm not by the water, I've got a whole bunch of other interests to keep me busy, like hitting the gym, gaming, gardening, woodworking, tinkering with cars, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
               In my journey through Computer Engineering, I've had the chance to dive into both hardware and software design. I've got to say, software engineering excites me the most. 
               It's a field where creativity knows no bounds, and there's always something new to learn. As a junior, I've taken on some pretty crucial courses, including data structures & algorithms, 
               computer systems, software engineering, and computer architecture. On top of that, I've had the awesome opportunity to work as a Software Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin during the summer of 2023. 
               It was a fantastic three months where I got to put my coursework into practice. I was working on full-stack Windows applications by contributing to mission planning software and tools.
            </p>
            <p>
               Looking ahead, I'm eager to build a career in Software Engineering and continue expanding my skill set in the vast world of computer science. Right now, I'm most comfortable with C++, given my coursework 
               and internship experience. However, I utilize other languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Java, and SQL. I've even dabbled with frameworks like Django, React, and Qt. I firmly 
               believe that once you've got a solid foundation in one language, picking up others becomes less daunting. Thus, I try not to limit myself to languages that I have the most experience with.
            </p>
            <p>With all that said, feel free to wander my site and learn more about me!</p>
