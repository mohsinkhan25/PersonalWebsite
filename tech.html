                <p>
                   I developed and maintained UAV mission planning software in C++ and the QT framework over the Summer of 2023.
                   I added new features, debugged issues, and maintained our application and services baseline. I was also 
                   given the opportunity to develop a prototype for a client-server data generation application.

            <p>
               I developed this financial literacy app initially at TAMUhack 2023. My team and I utilized NextJS with TypeScript
               at this hackathon to design and develop a website application to promote financial literacy. This app was prototyped
               as part of the PIMCO challenge.

            <p>
               Zeus Health is an app to help fitness geeks to track their workouts effectively. My role is to help with the development and deployment of the web app.
               I have not had much exposure working on this application but I have plans to help flesh out the idea and get it deployed.
